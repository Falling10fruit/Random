                <p>Me and <a href="">this guy</a>, pretty cool number tutor. Funny man, always happy even when I always get answers wrong and seem to watch YouTube during class

            <br>Oh yeah and my parents, for giving him money</p>

                <p>When you draw line, computer find the linear equation version of line. Computer play "pretend you're in the middle of the universe" and draw a perpidicular line that crosses your mouse point. Then grabs the intersection point of the perpindicylar line and see if the point is close to your circle mouse to bump.</p>

                        No living human would actually want to know and read through all this, but I like explaining things and put some meaningful comments in my github commit.
                        <br>
                        <br>Uh, so I don't actually need to "simulate" two perpindicular lines, that's just the concept of how a human would do it.
                        <br>
                        <br>For the computer, I just throw in an equation to immediately get the dot, whose equation is built upon the concept
                        <br>
                        <br>Here equation for finding:

                        <br>I'm using this linear equation: y = mx + k
                        <br>
                        <br>Before I got anywhere close to making the above, I was Google searching "How to solve two linear equations in Javascript" and almost made a Stack Overflow question, which I clearly doubted doing because it seemed more like a math problem and might lose me some reputation.
                        <br>
                        <br>Afterwards, I substracted the coordinates of the two points, that make up the line. So relatively, where the mouse used to be is now located in the middle
