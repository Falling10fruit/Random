        <h1>Eyoboy me parents go "Oh cool, but what line bump for?" EAUGH</h1>
        
        <p>I feel like screaming instead of doing this because I don't really know how to progress, do I build a weird slidey thing (Like from <a href="../TokoProgram2/">tOKoProgram</a>) from the <a href="../CircleLineBump/">first iteration</a> or.? And then how do I write code for ths? Do I copy and paste? Write from scratch in case I could think up of a cleaner, more readable code? Or no?</p>

            <br>6 June 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>The entire 2LineAngle - BallAngle idea is screwed</li>
                <li>It doesn't work in the first place</li>
                <li>Well, it does, but only in one line angle</li>
                <li>Also made the background blur toggleable</li>
            </ul>

            <br>4 June 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>I ALMOST DID IT</li>
                <li>ROOFS AND FLOORS WORK NOW</li>
                <li>IT CAN BOUNCE VERY WELL TO THE LEFT</li>
                <li>Still sometimes bounces upwards when going right</li>
                <li>Well, almost, not so slopy left lines still let balls pass through</li>
            </ul>

            <br>3 June 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>I did something</li>
                <li>It now phases directly down instead of right when it hits a horizontal line</li>
                <li>It can now bounce to the left</li>
                <li>Very jagged though, seems to like to bounce upwards</li>
                <li>Also removed some console.log s, the weird numbers in the console should disappear now</li>
            </ul>

            <br>2 June 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to rework the collisions in the first game of the p5.js thing, but my code was terrible</li>
                <li>Each entity didn't have any information on width, so I had to specify the collision distance for each pair of every type (white - white, white - yellow, white - orange, white - red, yellow - white...red - red)</li>
                <li>I was a much messier coder, showing off my "math skills" utilizing boolean-number thing to put everything into almost one block of code</li>
                <li>I'm still brainstorming to fix the collisions</li>
            </ul>

            <br>1 June 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>Technically finished the </li>
                <li>Eh, I think I should also add the option to not have the special background transperancy</li>
                <li>All I have in mind for the analysis is just the speed of the ball, basically the same as the <a href="https://falling10fruit.github.io/p5.jsProjects/ScrollingTest">Platformer thing</a></li>
                <li>Inspriaration from <a href="https://www.cell-lab.net/">Cell Lab</a>'s "cell analysis"</li>
                <li>Analysis's usability is all Pause has</li>

                <li>AAAAA 5 JUNE DUE HOMEWORK</li>
                <li>I made half of the analysis stuff, the grey background stuff, the text, an some agruments</li>
                <li>Eh, I think I should also add the option to not have the special background transperancy</li>
                <li>All I have in mind for the analysis is just the speed of the ball, basically the same as the <a href="https://falling10fruit.github.io/myp5.jsprojects/">Platformer thing</a></li>

            <ul>
                <li>EY I remembered that I was supposed to multiply the angle by Math.PI/180</li>
                <li>It now mostly works and sometimes not works with consistent results</li>
                <li>Debug circles of lag is now toggleable</li>
                <li>Remove lines button added</li>
                <li>Pause button</li>
                <li>Remove balls</li>
                <li>Undo making lines</li>
                <li>Nifty eh</li>
                <li>You can also undo removing all lines</li>
            </ul>

            <br>29 May 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>Well well well isn't it the consequences of my own actions</li>
                <li>I cahnged Lines[x].FirstDot to Lines[x].FirstDot.X</li>
                <li>It rarely sometimes work now</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <br>18 May 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>I tried to make the ball bounce on differently angled lines but the Intersection X position is not yessing</li>
                <li>I also made it so you can see the intersectio points for every ball for every line</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>25 May 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>Balls exist now</li>
                <li>It can bounce on straight verticle lines</li>
                <li>Fast balls don't skip, unless you make it even faster</li>
                <li>I don't know if I really cleaned up the code, it still feels like a jungle except I changed it into a rainforest</li>
                <li>Lessened the X drag to 9.6</li>
            </ul>

                <li>I forgot what I made</li>
                <li>Maybe I found out I could draw?</li>
                <li>Yeah I just managed to recreate the line draing thing</li>
                <li>I made this log</li>
                <li>Maybe I should also make the log for 25 May too</li>
