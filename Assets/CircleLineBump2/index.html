        <h1>Eyoboy me parents go "Oh cool, but what line bump for?" EAUGH</h1>
        
        <p>I feel like screaming instead of doing this because I don't really know how to progress, do I build a weird slidey thing (Like from <a href="../TokoProgram2/">tOKoProgram</a>) from the <a href="../CircleLineBump/">first iteration</a> or.? And then how do I write code for ths? Do I copy and paste? Write from scratch in case I could think up of a cleaner, more readable code? Or no?</p>

                <li>Well well well isn't it the consequences of my own actions</li>
                <li>I cahnged Lines[x].FirstDot to Lines[x].FirstDot.X</li>
                <li>It rarely sometimes work now</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I tried to make the ball bounce on differently angled lines but the Intersection X position is not yessing</li>
                <li>I also made it so you can see the intersectio points for every ball for every line</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Balls exist now</li>
                <li>It can bounce on straight verticle lines</li>
                <li>Fast balls don't skip, unless you make it even faster</li>
                <li>I don't know if I really cleaned up the code, it still feels like a jungle except I changed it into a rainforest</li>
                <li>Lessened the X drag to 9.6</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Yeah I just managed to recreate the line draing thing</li>
                <li>I made this log</li>
                <li>Maybe I should also make the log for 25 May too</li>
