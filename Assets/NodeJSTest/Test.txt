ah, nice, good for you! yeah, mine was pretty chill as well, although I still had my other "minor classes" (i.e. piano class, language classes, etc) so it felt woefully short üò¢

But it's always good to have a break; my brother can testify (if he checks this chat, that is; as you know we share this account) I was able to binge some YT as well üò∂
15:24
plus got to finish some minor projects that I was too lazy to finalize earlier, so that's sweet
