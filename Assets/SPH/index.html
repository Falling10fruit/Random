                <h2>Getting in</h2>
                
                <p>I woke up at 7 and I was still half asleep because I sleep at 1 AM. Anyways all my friends went first (As per usual) and found out that the dorm is smaller than I thought, greedy me. And I quickly found out ythat most preperations I made was to waste because we were pessimists, and the actual problems are always never foreseen. I had a great time checking out every nook and cranny and unpacking plus devotion time was more of laundry questions
                <br>
                <br>Also stop pressing backspace, Jason
                <br>Stop </p>
                
                <h2>Getting used to it</h2>

                <h3>Laundry</h3>
                
                <p>Laundry is hard. I was hoping that I got it right, wrote notes everywhere, and asked the same question 5 times to make sure to make sure that I got the thing right. Fortunately I got everything, but unfortunately it took so long that most ogf my pants was already used. Sad. Fortununately, I found a great alternative which was to wash the clothes myself and it was much, by far easier to do.</p>

                <h3>We live in a society</h3>

                <p>I quickly found out how not child-friendly the area is compared to what I thought, especially when I found out that Jason existed. But I've seen much worse and at least I can use much more, what should I call it, depressed jokes. It's still great nevertheless. Except when two certain people came in, so annoying, inappropiate, uncomfortable (I should stop now in case their parents - If they could guess that I'm talking about their child- see my work oh no).</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>

                <h3>Getting paid for eating <sub>how</sub></h3>

                <p>So at the very first day during lunch at school, somebody (Imma gonna call him <u>John</u>) paid me a <strong>FREAKING R.p. 25,000</strong> to eat his unwanted food! He then decided that I have to eat his leftovers for 5 days because my roomate (Who I will call <u>James</u>) was offered R.p. 5,000. Although I find this unfair because now I need to eat all of his's left overs over the course of 5 days, not five times. But I shouldn't complain, money is money.
                <br>
                <br>At least the "contract" ended when the worst breakfast was served, I don't think I could handle the peanut sauce (Almost nobody could, <u>James</u>> was pretty gritty though, what a good man). The contract was then renwed at sunday and <i>should</i> last all the way to Thursday. I say <i>should</i> because I can't tell the future and time of writing right now is Tuesday... So yeah. Gotta make some money, why let the window of oppurtunity pass?</p>>

                <h3>Borrowing money</h3>

                <p>At one moment, On of my friends (Now named <u>Hillary</u>) wanted to borrow my money so that he could buy himself a snack. So I let him borrow my money while I made sure the teachers can become witness. At first I thought he was going to give me exactly what the reciept said but he decied to round it up to the R.p. 5,000th (He gave me R.p. 15,000 when the reciept said about a little more than R.p. 13,000, gave the coin to <u>James</u> because why not). And I got bragging rights as my friends called me the son of <i>[Insert famous bussiness man here]</i>.</p>

                <h3>Not using the money the dorm gave me</h3>

                <p>We had the entire day to ourself in a mall, they give each of us R.p. 100,000 for lunch and dinner. So logically, I took three lasagnyas from breakfast for breakfast lunch and dinner without bringing a bottle. Due to extreme luck beyond my puny understanding, my friends decided to go eat somewhere with free refills. And because I completely disregard the saliva present in their food (How else am I supposed earn <u>John</u>'s money?) I took the opportunity and probably drank over one and a half gallons of tea (Yoshinoya) and soda (Carlo's). Plus <u>John</u> already renwed the contract and had some beef and rice (Noice, although the sambal )</p>
